"I've worked in this company for around 7 years now and I have enjoyed my time here so far. Not only are the staff very nice, but the job also pays well too. One thing that really helped me in this company was the food and snack program. When I graduated from college and just got into the company I was struggling with money. I was unable to afford a plate to eat but after getting into the company I was able to eat due to the free lunches and snacks provided, and keep myself energized which enhanced my working ability. This was really helpful as I was able to get myself back on my feet. Going into my 8th year I now have a house and am able to support myself."
